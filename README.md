# Face-Reconginition
This APP will detect multiple faces in the provided image.

***************************************

  Project name : Face Recognition Application
  Description: Amazing Website that will detect any face on an image. All You need to do is provide the URL of an image and click ‘Detect’ and It will display Your image and add borders around detected faces.
  This App currently only has Front-end and is developed using ReactJS (Styling is Tachyons and ParticleJS). I’m on my way to acquire knowledge of back-end (NodeJS and ExpressJS) and I will further this project at first possible convenience. Until then, have fun!

***************************************

  The best way to learn amazing framework like ReactJS is by doing projects. The reason why I picked this project is the API. Clarifai (https://www.clarifai.com/) has an amazing list of API and great documentation.
   I chose Face Recognition to do first because when I was in high school, the professor took us on a trip to check out ‘futurish tech gathering’ and one of those was an application that detects the faces on a live video of us, seeing I’m on the right way to accomplish that made me so proud of myself! From the moment I started coding, from the very first <html> till now, I can’t stop being amazed of how much astonishing projects awaits me!


***************************************
  
  Making this project made me realize how important is to make order, clean up and keep every component in its folder. 

  One of the problems was API, all thought the documentation was thorough I had some problems getting the math correct to place the information from boundry_box into styles to get the right coordinates to place the box onto the faces. 

  Not in the main frame, but I had some problems setting up particlesJS, but I just had to use it, it’s an amazing component!

  ***************************************
  
   As usual with me, I still think design lack a lot but I will get to it a bit more, specially because I have a lot of ideas to implement, such as navbar and implementing other APIs from Clarifai and back-end to upload and save own images, maybe even taking live image or video on Your device’s camera. 

  Special thanks once more for Clarifa for amazing machine learning API! 

  Feel free to share opinions and ask any question regarding the project!
  
  See you in the next one! :D
